These are the rules to Texas Hold'em:

A single 52-card deck is used. All cards count as its poker value. Aces may be high or low.

Two cards shall be dealt down to each player.

The player to the left of the big blind must either call or raise the big blind bet.

The small blind may also raise the big blind. 

Three community cards will be dealt face up in the center of the table. This is called the "flop."

Another round of betting will ensue, starting with the player to the dealer's left.

A fourth community card will be dealt face up in the center of the table. This card is called the "turn."

Another round of betting will ensue, starting with the player to the dealer's left. 

A fifth and final community card will be dealt face up in the center of the table. This card is called the "river."

Another round of betting will ensue, starting with the player to the dealer's left. 

Each player still in the game at the end will determine the highest poker value among his own two cards and the five community cards. It is NOT a requirement that the player use both of his own cards. The player with the hand of highest poker value shall win. Following are the hand rankings.

Straight flush: Five consecutive and suited cards.

Four of a kind: Four cards of the same rank, plus any fifth card.

Full house: Three of a kind and a pair. 

Flush: Any five cards of the same suit, except for a higher ranking straight flush.
Straight: Five consecutive cards, except for a higher ranking straight flush. 
Three of a kind: Three cards of the same rank, plus any other two cards.
Two pair: Two pairs, plus any fifth card. 

Pair: A pair and any other three cards. 

High: Any five cards that do not form any higher poker hand.

If two or more players have poker values of the same rank then the individual cards will be used to break the tie. If necessary all five cards will be considered.
